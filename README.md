## Abstract

## Research Questions
1. Given a specific topic, what is the most common profile among the speakers ?
2. Given a speaker's profile, what is the probability that he has talked about a certain topic ?

## Proposed additional datasets
- Wikidata : Will be used to obtain information about the speakers. 


## Methods
- Topic Filtering : 
- Regression Analysis : 

## Proposed timeline
### Week 09 (12/11/21 - 18/11/21) : 
- Load data : Gather Quotebank and Wikidata datasets and extract the desired information
- Feature processing for Quotebank : Clean data (Remove inessential features, quotes without speaker, etc)
- Topic Filtering : Associate each quote with a topic 
- Topic Filtering : Gather all quotes associated with a certain topic 
### Week 10 (19/11/21 - 25/11/21) : 
- Feature processing for Wikidata : Get the speaker attributes ready to be used as a training set
- Logistic regression : Train our model, Optimize parameters based on accuracy
- Data exploration/Observational studies : Try to derive information in other ways than regression analysis
### Week 11 (26/11/21 - 02/12/21) : 
- Results : Explore and interpret our results
- Conclusions : Draw conclusions from our results and find efficient ways to present them 
### Week 12 (03/12/21 - 09/12/21) : 
- Visualization : Visual our results 
- Statistical analysis
- Commence our report/data story
### Week 13 (10/12/21 - 17/12/21) : 
- Double check everything
- Finalize Data story
